# Role: Projects and Booths Management

**Time required** - 30-60 mins a day, a few weeks before the event.

## Tasks

### Pre-event:
- Shortlist community booths and projects, based on the form responses.
- Communicate with the booth participants, and answer their queries.
- Maintain a tracker for booth status and any special requirements from them.
- Follow up on any requirements by the booths, and redirect them to the respective team.
- Regularly check emails, ensuring no emails are missed. Cross-verify by searching the booth name if they haven't replied in a long while.

### During event:
- Visit all the booths and check if there are any problems.
- Be available to address any queries from the booths.

### Suggestions:
- Consider booth placement such that all booths are properly visible.
- Make sure to have the contact numbers of the logistics in charge and venue support team, so you don't have to search for them throughout the hall.
- Get measurements of the booth tables and TVs beforehand, so you can clearly mention the specifications.
